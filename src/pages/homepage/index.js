          Pridely is your new app, to help you find local businesses, which
          support and champion the LGBTQIA+ community.
        </p>
        <p>
          For too long, businesses have been able to discriminate against the
          LGBTQIA+ community, leaving people feeling unwelcome & unsupported. We
          aim to change that.
        </p>
        <p>At Pridely, everyone is welcome.</p>
